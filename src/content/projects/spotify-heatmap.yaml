      Spotify analysis endpoint always called out to me. Was it magic? Could Spotify detect notes?
  - text: I built Spotify Heatmap to find out.

      Since the application is essentially a visualization tool for Spotify's pitch analysis endpoint, I was able to experiment with different tracks
      and observe that it did very well with solo piano pieces and awfully terrible with percussion-heavy pieces. 
      For the former, it typically correctly identified the root and the third of whatever chord was playing.
      In the latter context, it usually recognized just the bassline accurately.

      Another principal reason I built Spotify Heatmap was to see if I could build and deploy a product within a week. 
      Heatmap was worked on for a week in February during the hours of 5-9pm inside an Echo Park bookstore.

      Using Astro made me realize how uncomfortable I was with using VanillaJS for UI and how lovely the React philosophy is. 
      I quickly realized the declarative nature of React replaces the cumbersome process of keeping track of dynamic elements
      and their associated event handlers with VanillaJS.q In React elements almost become a type of listener that you don't have to touch, just update the state they
      listen to. It prevents the mess of event handlers and element querying VanillaJS typically introduces into the codebase.

      I chose Astro because I heard it was a performant way to build site that weren't full-fledged applications.
      I also wanted to try out the hype I'd been hearing about.
      With Heatmap, I only ran into obstacles when components were dynamic and reliant on state (Astro docs even say it is focused on content not interactivity).
      If this app were larger and required lots more shared state across components, it would be easy to make a mess of things just HTML and VanillaJS.
      You would have to engineer solutions that the Next.js/React combo already provides.

      Heatmap plans for the future would be to make the UI more visually appealing, make it work on Safari, create additional visualizations for Spotify's other audio
      analysis endpoints, create blog posts informally discussing the findings of the visualizations, and including information on how the visualizations work
      and what they represent.
