      Ah, my first job ever.
  - text: >
      As a contractor, a lot of uncertainty, minimal guidance, and the 
      tasks low on the totem pole. I make these sound like bad things, but
      these experiences forced me to find pockets of potential wherever I could,
      rely on my own to acquanit myself to things I did not understand and 
      collaborate with people I wasn't sure I would see in six months.

      In my difference roles with Capgemini I've built testing pipelines, led a QA team, 
      designed test suites, automated mnual processes, and delivered products to stakeholders as the sole developer.

      You'd think it's great to work solo on an internal project, but you are the sole person that answers to 
      stakeholder demands and convinces them of all the decisions you make. I learned this is where rapid wireframing and iteration
      in developing the product really helps.
