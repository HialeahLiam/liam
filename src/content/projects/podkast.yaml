      To make an iOS app I had to learn a whole new paradigm of app building. There was no DOM
      and I had to return to my object-oriented programming roots to utilizes Apple's ViewController-based
      UI architecture. I had to navigate Apple's extensive but at times excessive collection of iOS 
      libraries to choose appropriate classes and methods for my use cases.

      It felt like I had joined a company where Apple's Swift books were the only onboarding documents
      I recieved and I had to figure out how to use the company's libraries to immediately create a demo project.
      Like in a real company, wou will be overwhelmed by the options to choose from and will often have minimal guidance 
      when creating an application on your own. I was forced to be selective with what I learned and used
      and be effective in implementing features with myh minimal knowledge of the iOS ecosystem.

      I had to develop workarounds to since I was dependent on an external API I had no control over.

      I leveraged the API to emulate functionality without actually implementing it. I let Spotify do all the work 
      of storing and playing back audio snippets. I only had to store snippet metadata. I learned, if you can, always
      let others do the work for you.

      Experimenting with a new language and environment was like visiting another country. It reminded 
      me that in development, like in life, there are multiple ways of accomplishing something. You might 
      find a better solution in another approach, or that approach might make you cherish your approach even more.

      Discovering that your idea was executed by a Switzerland based start up with investor funding is a very assuring feeling. 
      If you run into competition, it means youâ€™re doing something right.
