      Back in November 2022, I had been itching to launch a product that was actually utilitarian and did not 
      require an existing user base to function.

      So I created Podkast!

      After spending weeks brainstorming product ideas, the development Gods whispered into my ear while I lay in bed 
      listening to Dax Shepard talk about surfing in Hawaii: I'll make an app that let's you save snippets of Spotify 
      podcasts!

      My ambition had been to create an MVP as fast as I possibly could and submit it to the App Store.
      To make an iOS app I had to learn a whole new paradigm of app building. There was no DOM
      and I had to return to my object-oriented programming roots to utilizes Apple's ViewController-based
      UI architecture. I had to navigate Apple's extensive but at times excessive collection of iOS 
      libraries to choose appropriate classes and methods for my use cases.

      I felt like I had joined a company where Apple's Swift books were the only onboarding documents
      I recieved and I had to quickly figure out how to use the company's libraries.
      I was forced to be selective with what I used
      and  effective in implementing features with my minimal knowledge of the iOS ecosystem.

      As for how I implemented the storage and playback of podcast snippets,
      I leveraged Spotify's web API to emulate functionality without actually implementing it. I let Spotify do all the work 
      of storing and playing back audio snippets, I only had to store snippet metadata. I learned, if you can, always
      let others do the work for you.

      Experimenting with a new language and environment was like visiting another country. It reminded 
      me that in development, like in life, there are multiple ways of accomplishing something. You might 
      find a better solution in another approach, or that approach might make you cherish your approach even more.

      Ultimately, I gave up on the project after finding Snipd, an app that already had accomplished Podkast's ambitions, and far better!
      Around that time, I began to work on Brew.fm and decided to continue investing time into web development instead of the iOS ecosystem.
      However, discovering that your idea was executed by a Switzerland-based start up with investor funding was a very assuring feeling. 
      If you run into competition, it means you were doing something right!
