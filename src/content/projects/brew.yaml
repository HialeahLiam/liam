      The brainchild of another, Brew has gifted me phenomenal learning experience.

      While working on my iOS app, Podkast, I stumbled onto Brew and admired its beautifully crafted UI and
      its ingenuity in leveraging Spotify's Web API to track new releases you actually care about.
      I was so captivated by it, in fact, that I reached out to its creator Bart Proost through Twitter.
      After a few chats and beers in Los Feliz, I began working on Brew myself!

      Our main motivation with Brew at the moment is to have our 3000+ users reengage with the application by introducing 
      a social component to Brew. Since I've joined, we have refactored the code to replace our use of Firebase's Firestore and Cloud Functions with
      tRPC, Prisma and a relational database to ensure type safety across the entire stack. We have also transformed our algorithm for track recommendations
      to sort the recommendations based on user hierarchies we create for each seed track.

      I feel very fortunate to have worked with Bart and to have pulled back the curtains of a product I envied and see its insides. 

      I've learned that when shipping a product alone or with a small team, the insides typically do not reflect what is shown on the outside. The execution of ideas trumps the robustness of your code. 
      You shouldnâ€™t stay married to your ideas until they produce results. Then can you make your code robust!
