This is the code to my personal site.

As someone born in 1999 having grown up without and then with contemporary technology, I'm tired of being inundated with content.

Too many words.
Too many links.
Am I even real if all I do is consume pixel content?

As a response to the phenomenon of becoming a digital serf, I decided to make a barebones design for my site. I wanted it straightforward, underwhelming in content, and intriguing to look at.

I'm not a designer though (yet). So to make my vision a reality I borrowed (stole) the design from [this awesome cat site](https://cat.humbleteam.com).

# Using Astro

I heard a lot about Astro through the [JS Party Podcast by Changelog](https://changelog.com/jsparty/238).

It's a JS framework geared specifically towards static and content-rich sites.

React is my frontend tool of choice, but I'm a sucker for the initiative to keep things stupid simple. My site was the perfect opportunity to play around with Astro.
