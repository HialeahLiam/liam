# Liam Idrovo says hi

This is the code to my personal site.

I'm tired of being inundated with content.

Too many words.

Too many links.

Am I even real if all I do is consume pixel content?

As a revolt to becoming a digital serf, I decided to make a barebones design for my site. I wanted it straightforward, underwhelming in content, but intriguing to look at.

I'm not a designer though (yet), so to make my vision a reality I borrowed (stole) the design from [this awesome cat site](https://cat.humbleteam.com).

# Using Astro

I heard a lot about Astro through the [JS Party Podcast by Changelog](https://changelog.com/jsparty/238).

It's a JS framework geared specifically towards static and content-rich sites.

React is my frontend tool of choice, but I'm a sucker any initiative to keep things stupid simple. My site was the perfect opportunity to play around with Astro.
